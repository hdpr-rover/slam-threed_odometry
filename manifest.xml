  <description brief="3D Wheel and Leg Mobile Robots Odometry library">
  This package contains a collection of odometry classes and configuration
  types, which calculate the 6D relative movement of the robot depending on
  a/change in the state of the robots actuators using 3D Kinematics.
  Different robot classes are supported like e.g. wheel or legged systems are covered.
  This 3D kinematics can also be enanced to provide near dynamic model fidelity
  ate less computational cost than dynamic models.

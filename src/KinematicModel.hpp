 * @brief Kinematic Model Abstract class
 *
 * This is the Template Abstract class for the Forward kinematics of  Wheel or Leg Robot
 * considering all the DOFs in the Kinematics Chains (Trees). Basically the forward kinematics
 * transform wheel/Leg contact points position with respect to the body_frame considering the
 * joint values (chain configuration). The wheelJacobian or legJacobian works in velocity space
 * and gives information of each wheel/leg contact point to the contribution of the movement
 * (rover angular and linear velocities).
 *
 * It has been designed to use together with the MotionModel Solver (Least-Squares solver)
 * implemented in the MotionModel.hpp file of this library.
 *
 * It should first compute the forward kinematics in order to have afterwards the Robot Jacobian.
 * Neither the forward kinematics nor the Jacobian are provided by this class since this is an
 * abstract class and the kinematics is platform dependent. Your class should make this job.
 *
 *
 * The rational behind is to have a wrapper abstract class to solve the statistical motion model
 * of any complex robot. The goal is for odometry (localization) purpose in a unify way.
 * The real implementation of the Robot Kinematic Model which would inherits from this class can use
 * any method. This means that either analytical or numerical solutions can be internally apply.
 * An example of numerical solution is the KDL library. An example of analytical is your own closed-form.
 * Since forward kinematics is normally quite easy to get an analytical form is recommended.
 * However, if your robot kinematics is complex
 * and for control purpose you have a Tree structure representation for numerical
 * inverse kinematics in KDL/or similar. Perhaps, it is worthy to wrap this kinematic tree
 * implementation with this class.
 *
 * Anyway, the important aspect is to commit the interface. The nomenclature attempts to be generic.
 * An important issue with respect to a conventional kinematics is that a 3D slip vector
 * is modeled as part of the DoF of the kinematics in the form of displacement/rotation
 * vector (x, y and rot theta). Located at the frame between the robot contact point (feet/wheel)
 * and the ground.

     *
     * Kinematic Model Abstract class
     *
     * @param _Scalar: is the typename of your desired implementation (float, double, etc..)
     * @param _RobotTrees: is the number of independent Trees connected to your desired Body Center.
     *              Trees is understood as connection of kinematics chains. As an example:
     *              <a href="http://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/forschung/robotersysteme/asguard-ii.html">Asguard</a>
     *              hybrid wheels model as Trees. Therefore Asguard has 4 Trees. Each Tree has 5 open
     *              kinematics chains, one per each foot which are potential points in contact with
     *              the ground. The number of Trees defines the number of contact points where the robot contact the ground.
     *
     * @param _RobotJointDoF: Complete number of DoF in the Joint Space of your robot.This is every joint
     *              passive or active that your robot (or the part of your robot related to odometry)
     *              has. This is required to the Jacobian in a general form. Therefore, this would
     *              be the part of the number of columns in the Kinematic Model Jacobian matrix.
     *
     * @param _SlipDoF: The number of DoF than you want to model the slip of the contact point. If you
     *           are not interested to model slip velocity/displacement set it to zero. Otherwise,
     *           a common slip model has 3DoF (in X an Y direction and Z rotation)
     *
     * @param _ContactDoF: This is the angle of contact between the ground and the contact point. If it 
     *              is not interesting for you model (i.e: the robot moves in indoor environment)
     *              set it to zero. Otherwise in uneven terrains normally is modeled as 1DoF along th
     *              pitch axis. For walking robots it could have 2DoF one along the Y axis/Pitch at the feet frame
     *              (dominant when moving forward) and another along the X axis/Roll at the feet frame
     *              (dominant when moving sideways).
     *
     * Note that it is very important how you specify the number of Trees according to the contact points.
     * It is assumed that one Tree can only have one single point of contact with the ground at the same time.
     * Therefore, if your real/physical kinematic Tree can have more than one contact point at a time (e.g: two)
     * the Tree needs to be split according to it (e.g: two Trees).
     *
     * For example, taking <a href="http://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/forschung/robotersysteme/asguard-ii.html">Asguard</a> wheel
     * as an example. If we want to model the wheel as two feet can have point in contact, two Trees
     * needs to be created in the wheel (virtually increasing the number of Trees).
